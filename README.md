# case_ufo_sightings
**This was the case in my course which was markable , for it have been my first time to accomplish a case.**  

## Case info.
- Dataset : UFO-sighting records throughout the world
- Purpose : output the plot in file named "ufo_sightings"

## Annotation
- "ufo_sightings.pdf" -> case purpose
- "Number of UFO sightings by Month−Year and U.S. State (1990−2010).pdf" -> my final result
- "Number of UFO sightings by Month−Year and U.S. State (1980−2001).pdf" -> my result of first stage(first 10000 obs.)
- "ufo(first 10000 obs.).R" -> R code for the first 10000 obs.
- "ufo(full data).R" -> R code for the full data

## Remarks
- The codes are somewhat not concise , because I wanted to preserve my original train of thought , in contrast to  improvements  which would be made afterards.

- Comments amid codes are, partly in Chinese ,partly in English. Its embarrassed ,due to there being some bugs in Input Method. 

## sth to say
When teacher assigned this case ,I took it serious. And it cost about 3 days to do this.

I began the case with very limited knowledge on R . To realize every periodical targets , I refered to tutorials, books ,Internet, as well as read source codes of R functions. 

For instance, to come out with ways of reading  every single character of a string , I went over source code of function "as.Date.character" thinking of note that "as.Date.character" is able to identify every character of a string , there would be some codes inspiring me. 

Then ,function "strptime" was found out . Furthermore ,the class of function begun with "str-" emerged .At last , I picked "strsplit" to realize my identification ,ideally.    

From the aspect of complexity , I have realized the case's purpose on first 500 ,first 10000 ,full dataset ,successively.

By doing this case ,I have a more profound understanding of explory learning and get a sense of achivement.

But , to my most regret, when teacher asked ,in the class, whether there was anybody having tried to accomplish ,or better, finished the assignment, there was no one raising hand INCLUDING MEEEEEEE!!!!!

Im just too shy to speak out in class.I have been so regretful and do not feel better till NOW .

You may feel unbelivable,but it did occur to me. I can not overcome my fearness to speak in front of the public.
